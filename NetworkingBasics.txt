TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model

# | Layer Name  |     Protocol      | Protocol Data Unit | Addressing
5 | Application | HTTP, SMTP, etc.. |  Messages          | n/a
4 | Transport   | TCP/UDP           |  Segment           | Port #'s
3 | Network     | IP                |  Datagram          | IP address
2 | Data link   | Ethernet, Wi-Fi   |  Frames            | MAC address
1 | Physical    | 10 Base T, 802.11 |  Bits              | n/a



Collission Domain - A network segment where only one device can
communicate at a time.

MAC(Media Access Control) address

Client - something that requests data from server.

Switch - a device that connects lots of devices and remembers
which ones are connected to each interface.
       - a device that will have the most network ports

TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)

Network Layer - TCP/IP model that use IP

TCP and UDP(User Datagram Protocol) - works at Transport Layer
and ensures that data gets to the right applications running on
those nodes

A system has defined specification that describe how signals are
sent over connections. Which layer of the TCP/IP model provides
this function?
X - Transport
TRY - Data link

Cables - allow you to form point-to-point networking connections

Router - a device that forwards data and operates at third layer
Network Layer in TCP/IP

Modulation/Line coding - sends ones and zeroes across network
cables

CSMA/CD(Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)
- used to determine when the communications channels are clear
and when a device is free to transmit data.

The first three octet of MAC address identify the manufacturer
of a network interface.

EtherType field - a section of ethernet frame wher you will
find a VLAN(Virtual Local Area Network) header

Where is the Start Frame Delimiter(SFD) found in an ethernet frame?
X - The last byte of EtherType field
TRY - The last byte of the preamble
